\title{Scarcity for a single community}
\usage{
scarcity_com(com_df, sp_col, abund)
}
\arguments{
\item{com_df}{a stacked (= tidy) data.frame from a single community with
each row representing a species in a community}

\item{sp_col}{a character vector, the name of the species column in
\code{com_df}}

\item{abund}{a character vector, the name of the column containing
relative abundances values}
}
\value{
the same data.frame with the additional \strong{Si} column giving
   scarcity values for each species
}
\description{
Given a stacked data.frame compute species scarcity. Scarcity measures how
abundant is a species locally. Scarcity is close to 1 when a species is rare
in a community and close to 0 when it is abundant. See
\code{\link[funrar]{scarcity}} function or the functional rarity indices
vignette included in the package
(type \code{vignette("rarity_indices", package = "funrar")}) for details
about the index.

\seealso{
\code{\link[funrar]{scarcity}} and

scarcity metric;
