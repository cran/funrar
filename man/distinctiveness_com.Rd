\title{Functional Distinctiveness for a single community}
\usage{
distinctiveness_com(com_df, sp_col, abund = NULL, dist_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{com_df}{a stacked (= tidy) data.frame from a single community with
each row representing a species in a community}

\item{sp_col}{a character vector, the name of the species column in
\code{com_df}}

\item{abund}{a character vector, the name of the column containing
relative abundances values}

\item{dist_matrix}{a functional distance matrix as given by
\code{compute_dist_matrix()}, with species name as row and column names}
}
\value{
the same data.frame with the additional \strong{Di} column giving
   functional distinctiveness values for each species
}
\description{
Given a stacked data.frame and a distance matrix compute the functional
distinctiveness for a single community. Functional distinctiveness relates to
the functional "originality" of a species in a community. The closer to 1 the
more the species is functionally distinct from the rest of the community. See
\code{\link[funrar]{distinctiveness}} function or the functional rarity
indices vignette included in the package
(type \code{vignette("rarity_indices", package = "funrar")}), for more details
on the metric.

\section{Caution}{

This function is meant for internal uses mostly, thus it does not include any
tests on inputs and may fail unexpectedly. Please use
\code{\link[funrar]{distinctiveness_stack}} to avoid input errors.
